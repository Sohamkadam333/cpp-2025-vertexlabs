# Basic Input / Output

#### In C++, input and output are performed in the form of a sequence of bytes or more commonly known as streams.

### Input Stream: 
#### If the direction of flow of bytes is from the device (for example, Keyboard) to the main memory then this process is called input.

### Output Stream: 
#### If the direction of flow of bytes is opposite, i.e. from main memory to device (display screen) then this process is called output.


#### All of these streams are defined inside the <iostream> header file which contains all the standard input and output tools of C++. The two instances cout and cin of iostream class are used very often for printing outputs and taking inputs respectively. These two are the most basic methods of taking input and printing output in C++.
