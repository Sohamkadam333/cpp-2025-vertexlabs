# History

C++ is an object-oriented programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in the late 1970s. Initially called "C with Classes," it was designed to enhance the C language by adding features like active type checking, inheritance, and classes. The name was changed to C++ in 1983, symbolizing an increment over C.

Stroustrup's work was influenced by the Simula language, which was the first to support object-oriented programming but was too slow for practical use. C++ aimed to combine the efficiency of C with object-oriented capabilities. The first compiler, Cfront, translated C++ code into C and was notable for being self-hosting.

In 1985, Stroustrup published "The C++ Programming Language," marking C++'s commercial introduction. The language underwent several updates, including the addition of features like virtual functions and function overloading. The first international standard, C++98, was released in 1998, followed by C++03 in 2003, which addressed issues in the original standard.

C++11, finalized in 2011, introduced significant features such as a new for loop syntax, a standard threading library, and variadic templates. The latest versions, C++20 and the upcoming C++23, continue to evolve the language. C++ remains popular, especially in competitive programming, due to its speed and powerful features like the Standard Template Library (STL), operator overloading, and multiple inheritance. Despite its complexity for beginners, C++ effectively combines low-level efficiency with high-level programming capabilities.
