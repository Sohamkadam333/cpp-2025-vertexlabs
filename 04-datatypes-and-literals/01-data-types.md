# Data Types
#### Data types specify the type of data that a variable can store. Whenever a variable is defined in C++, the compiler allocates some memory for that variable based on the data type with which it is declared as every data type requires a different amount of memory.

## In C++, data types are classified into the following types:

### 1. Basic Data Types
#### Built-in or primitive data types that are used to store simple values.
- int
- float
- double
- char
- bool
- void

### 2. Derived Data Types
#### Data types derived from basic types.
- array
- pointer
- reference
- function

### 3. User Defined Data Types
#### Custom data types created by the programmer according to their need.
- class
- struct
- union
- typedef
- using
