# Pointers

#### Pointers are symbolic representations of addresses. They enable programs to simulate call-by-reference as well as to create and manipulate dynamic data structures. Iterating over elements in arrays or other data structures is one of the main use of pointers.

### How to use a pointer?

- Define a pointer variable
- Assigning the address of a variable to a pointer using the unary operator (&) which returns the address of that variable.
- Accessing the value stored in the address using unary operator (*) which returns the value of the variable located at the address specified by its operand.


```cpp
// C++ program to illustrate Pointers

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
void print()
{
    int var = 20;

    // declare pointer variable
    int* ptr;

    // note that data type of ptr and var must be same
    ptr = &var;

    // assign the address of a variable to a pointer
    cout << "Value at ptr = " << ptr << "\n";
    cout << "Value at var = " << var << "\n";
    cout << "Value at *ptr = " << *ptr << "\n";
}
// Driver program
int main() 
{ 
  print(); 
  return 0;
}
```


### References and Pointers
There are 3 ways to pass C++ arguments to a function:

- Call-By-Value
- Call-By-Reference with a Pointer Argument
- Call-By-Reference with a Reference Argument

```cpp
// C++ program to illustrate call-by-methods

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Pass-by-Value
int square1(int n)
{
    // Address of n in square1() is not the same as n1 in
    // main()
    cout << "address of n1 in square1(): " << &n << "\n";

    // clone modified inside the function
    n *= n;
    return n;
}
// Pass-by-Reference with Pointer Arguments
void square2(int* n)
{
    // Address of n in square2() is the same as n2 in main()
    cout << "address of n2 in square2(): " << n << "\n";

    // Explicit de-referencing to get the value pointed-to
    *n *= *n;
}
// Pass-by-Reference with Reference Arguments
void square3(int& n)
{
    // Address of n in square3() is the same as n3 in main()
    cout << "address of n3 in square3(): " << &n << "\n";

    // Implicit de-referencing (without '*')
    n *= n;
}
void print()
{
    // Call-by-Value
    int n1 = 8;
    cout << "address of n1 in main(): " << &n1 << "\n";
    cout << "Square of n1: " << square1(n1) << "\n";
    cout << "No change in n1: " << n1 << "\n";

    // Call-by-Reference with Pointer Arguments
    int n2 = 8;
    cout << "address of n2 in main(): " << &n2 << "\n";
    square2(&n2);
    cout << "Square of n2: " << n2 << "\n";
    cout << "Change reflected in n2: " << n2 << "\n";

    // Call-by-Reference with Reference Arguments
    int n3 = 8;
    cout << "address of n3 in main(): " << &n3 << "\n";
    square3(n3);
    cout << "Square of n3: " << n3 << "\n";
    cout << "Change reflected in n3: " << n3 << "\n";
}
// Driver program
int main() 
{ 
  print();
  return 0;
}
```

### Array Name as Pointers

#### An array name contains the address of the first element of the array which acts like a constant pointer. It means, the address stored in the array name canâ€™t be changed. For example, if we have an array named val then val and &val[0] can be used interchangeably. 

```cpp
// C++ program to illustrate Array Name as Pointers
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
void print()
{
    // Declare an array
    int val[3] = { 5, 10, 20 };

    // declare pointer variable
    int* ptr;

    // Assign the address of val[0] to ptr
    // We can use ptr=&val[0];(both are same)
    ptr = val;
    cout << "Elements of the array are: ";
    cout << ptr[0] << " " << ptr[1] << " " << ptr[2];
}
// Driver program
int main() { 
  print(); 
  }

```
